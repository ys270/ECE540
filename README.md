# malloc_implement
Tests were ran on Duke virtual machine with Ubuntu 18.
```
make
cd alloc_policy_tests
make

# FF
$ ./small_range_rand_allocs
$ ./equal_size_allocs
$ ./large_range_rand_allocs

# BF
$ ./small_range_rand_allocs
$ ./equal_size_allocs
$ ./large_range_rand_allocs
```
Did not pass all the test cases for this assignment in this version. 
The Best way to implement this project is to track only the freelist.
